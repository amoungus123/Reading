            <h2>My Hobby</h2>
            <p>My hobby is reading. I like reading because there are soo many types of books you can read. My favroite types of books are realistic fiction. My favrotie author is Rick Riordan. He wrote the Percy Jackson and the Olympians Series, Kane Chronicles Series, The Heroes of Olympus Series, Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard Series, and The Trials of Apollo Series. My favriote book by him is The Last Olympian (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 5). I also like Wonder by, R. J. Palacio.</p>
